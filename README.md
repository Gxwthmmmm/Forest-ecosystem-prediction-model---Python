# Forest-ecosystem-prediction-model---Python
This project simulates and predicts transitions in a forest ecosystem over time using Markov Chains and Random Forest Classifier. It demonstrates both rule-based (probabilistic) modeling and a supervised machine learning approach to forecast land cover changes (e.g., Pine Forest, Mixed Hardwood, Old Growth).

Features:
1.Markov Chain simulation of forest state transitions
2.Steady-state distribution computation
3.Synthetic data generation to mimic real-world conditions
4.Machine learning model to predict ecosystem transitions based on environmental factors
5.Time evolution visualization of forest composition

Concepts Used
1.Markov Chains: Used to simulate forest evolution based on fixed transition probabilities.
2.Random Forest Classifier: Trained to predict future forest states based on climate and human activity features.
3.Steady-State Calculation: Derives long-term behavior of the ecosystem.

Data Visualization: Tracks changes in forest composition over multiple time steps.
